# Let's Run It

Let's Run It is an AI-powered automation platform designed for "Vibe Testing" and intelligent browser automation. It
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Playwright to explore websites, generate Gherkin-based features, and execute
them as automated tests.

### What is "Vibe Testing"?

"Vibe Testing" is our approach to automation that focuses on **heuristic-based exploration** rather than just rigid,
pre-defined assertions. Instead of only checking if a specific button exists, the AI assesses if the "vibe" of the page
is correct—meaning it looks right, contains the expected information, and offers the intended user journey. It allows
for testing complex, dynamic interfaces where traditional brittle selectors often fail.
